# Difference between SD and HD downloader
As the name says the SD downloader downloads the SD version of the image (generally 850 x 1160) whereas the HD downloader downloads the HD version of the image (4050 x 3050).  

__NOTE:__ _The HD downloader is little slower than than the SD downloader, since it searches for HD image links which adds a good amount of overhead._

For example look at the following two images (_open the image in new tab_).
* __SD downloader__

* __HD downloader__
